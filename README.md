basics that i learned with internet guidance from some guy on YouTube named Traversy Media 
followed his facebook login tutorial

i've changed the code slightly by adding a html based facebook logout pic and imported it into a basic html template that was included with dreamweaver.. i'm new to web development and spent three days pissing arround with css stylesheets trying to reposition javascript code.. hope this helps somebody and i might update this in future if i continue to build sites..

easy to mod change the code below in templatelogout.html to relocate buttons. :o

#facebook-login-button{
  position: absolute;
  left: 100px;
  top: 150px;
}
#facebook-logout-link{
  position: absolute;
  left: 100px;
  top: 150px;
}
